A book store management database created for CFGDegree's SQL course

As part of the course's 8-week course, I created a simple database centered around a book store management system, which demonstrates creating lists (fiction and non-fiction titles) and creating functions that calculate what would happen if certain titles run out or if books/authors don't exist within the database. While not explored in this database, there is potential to expand the information here to include itemizing/shipping orders and applying discounts to bulk orders depending on a customer's membership card.
